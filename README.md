## Usage

### Calendar Card

Add a calendar card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: calendar
entities:
  - calendar.exchange_your_email_example_com
```

### Services

#### Create Event
```yaml
service: calendar.create_event
target:
  entity_id: calendar.exchange_your_email_example_com
data:
  summary: "Team Meeting"
  start_date_time: "2025-03-01 10:00:00"
  end_date_time: "2025-03-01 11:00:00"
  description: "Weekly sync"
  location: "Conference Room A"
```

#### Automations

Use calendar events as triggers:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Meeting reminder"
    trigger:
      - platform: calendar
        event: start
        entity_id: calendar.exchange_your_email_example_com
        offset: "-00:15:00"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Meeting starts in 15 minutes!"
```

### Voice Assistant (Voice PE / Assist)

The integration is compatible with the Home Assistant Assist pipeline, allowing you to query calendar events using voice commands:

- **"What's on my calendar tomorrow?"** - Query events using natural language
- **"What do I have next week?"** - Supports relative date expressions

Event times are automatically converted to the local timezone, so the voice assistant always reports the correct time.

> **Tip**: For best results, use the OpenAI Conversation integration with `gpt-4o`. The `gpt-4o-mini` model can sometimes be inaccurate with date calculations.

## Options

After initial setup, you can modify these options via **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Exchange Calendar** > **Configure**:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Days to fetch | 14 | How many days ahead to fetch events |
| Max events | 50 | Maximum number of events to display |
| Update interval | 5 min | How often to poll the Exchange server |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot connect to Exchange server
- Verify the server hostname is correct and reachable from your HA instance
- For on-premise: ensure EWS endpoint is accessible (`https://server/EWS/Exchange.asmx`)
- For self-signed certificates: enable "Allow insecure SSL"
- Check HA logs for detailed error messages

### Authentication failed
- NTLM: Try both `user@domain.com` and `DOMAIN\user` formats
- OAuth2: Verify admin consent was granted for `Calendars.ReadWrite`
- OAuth2: Ensure the client secret hasn't expired

### No events showing
- Check that the mailbox has calendar events within the configured date range
- Increase "Days to fetch" in options
- Verify the email address matches the mailbox

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.1.0 or later
- Network access to your Exchange server (on-premise) or Office 365
- Python library: `exchangelib` (automatically installed)
